## Welcome to the SPARQL API project: A collection of simple extensions of Jena offering many goodies!
This library offers several [Jena](http://jena.apache.org/)-compatible ways to *transparently* add delays, caching, pagination and even query transformations before sending off your original SPARQL query.

TODO Maven + Examples goes here.

This library as of now is composed of two modules:
* `sparql-api`: Contains the core interfaces and basic implementations.
* `sparql-server`: An abstract SPARQL enpdoint class that allows you to easily create your own SPARQL endpoint. For example, the SPARQL-SQL rewriter [Sparqlify](http://github.com/AKSW/Sparqlify) is implemented against these interfaces.
