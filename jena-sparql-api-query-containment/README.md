# Query Containment Module

This module contains interfaces and abstract algorithms for query containment.
"Abstract" means, that these implementations are not bound to a specific API, but instead are parameterized using a combination of generics and lambdas.



## Graph based containment checks


### Converting algebra expressions to RDF graphs
```
QueryToJenaGraph.
```

### Converting predicate expressions to RDF graphs
```
QueryToJenaGraph.
```



### Abstract Interfaces

```java
public interface QueryContainmentIndex<K, G, N, A, V> {
}
```


```
```


### Mapping Expression
